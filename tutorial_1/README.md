# MATHGR5430 in the Spring 2022 - Tutorial 1 - Konstantin Kuchenmeister

Goals of Tutorial 1:

The goal is to provide a quick overview of Python and the specialities not common in other languages (for those already familiar with other languages). Furthermore we will take a first look at Pandas and Numpy.

1.   Python refresher      
- (Important) Data Types and operations
- Control Flow
- Functions
- Simple object oriented concepts

2.   Pandas and Numpy
- A brief overview of Pandas Dataframes and the most important observations
- A brief overview of Numpy 


Things to note:
- Python is an interpreted language, not compiled (you can run it line by line)
- Type declaration at interpretation time not necessary (happens at runtime) 
- We will work with Python 3       
- This tutorial is no way exhaustive...
